# S.C.A.L.E 2025 - SkyLink Airlines Digital Transformation

## Project Overview

This repository contains the business and technical solutions developed for the S.C.A.L.E 2025 case competition, focusing on **SkyLink Airlines' digital transformation journey**. As part of SAP's Solution Advisory Team, we are addressing critical operational challenges faced by this mid-sized international carrier operating 300+ daily flights across 50 destinations.

## Company Background

**SkyLink Airlines** is a global aviation company with:
- 📍 **50 destinations** worldwide
- ✈️ **300+ daily flights**
- 👥 **~6,000 employees**
- 🎯 Mixed business and leisure travelers (domestic & international)

Despite steady demand, SkyLink faces critical operational inefficiencies due to outdated infrastructure and disconnected processes that threaten their competitiveness in the data-driven aviation industry.

## Target Challenges

We are implementing solutions for the following three tactical challenges:

### 🔧 Challenge 1: Fragmented Data Systems
**Problem**: Core operational functions (ticket booking, flight scheduling, aircraft maintenance) run on separate, non-integrated platforms creating data silos.

**Impact**: 
- Slower, error-prone decision-making
- Manual data reconciliation
- Lack of real-time cross-functional visibility
- Reactive rather than proactive operations

### 📊 Challenge 2: Poor Demand Forecasting & Pricing Optimization
**Problem**: Basic forecasting methods fail to accurately predict demand, with manual ticket pricing limiting dynamic market response.

**Impact**:
- Underbooked flights or overcapacity issues
- Lost revenue opportunities
- Inability to leverage yield management strategies
- Poor response to market changes and competitor pricing

### 🔩 Challenge 3: Inefficient Aircraft Maintenance Management
**Problem**: Reactive maintenance operations without predictive capabilities or centralized tracking systems.

**Impact**:
- Unplanned downtime and frequent delays
- Higher operational costs
- Suboptimal aircraft utilization
- Avoidable service disruptions

## Our Solution Approach

### Business Strategy
- **Timeline**: 12-18 month implementation window
- **Budget**: Limited budget constraints
- **Compliance**: Strict aviation safety and data privacy requirements
- **Focus**: Tangible business value delivery

### Technical Implementation
Our prototype solutions will address the three challenges through:

1. **Integrated Data Platform**: Unified system connecting booking, scheduling, and maintenance
2. **AI-Powered Forecasting**: Dynamic pricing and demand prediction system
3. **Predictive Maintenance System**: Proactive maintenance scheduling and aircraft optimization

### Technology Stack
- **SAP Technologies**: Integration of relevant SAP solutions
- **UI Framework**: SAP UI5 for enterprise-grade user experience
- **Analytics**: AI/ML capabilities for predictive insights
- **Integration**: APIs for seamless data flow across systems
