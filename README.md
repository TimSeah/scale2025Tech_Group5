*Revolutionising SkyLink with intelligent, effortless tools to streamline your workflow, enhance collaboration, and achieve more—seamlessly.*

## Company Background

**SkyLink Airlines** is a global aviation company with:
- 📍 **50 destinations** worldwide
- ✈️ **300+ daily flights**
- 👥 **~6,000 employees**
- 🎯 Mixed business and leisure travelers (domestic & international)

Despite steady demand, SkyLink faces critical operational inefficiencies due to outdated infrastructure and disconnected processes that threaten their competitiveness in the data-driven aviation industry.

## Target Challenges

We are implementing solutions for the following three tactical challenges:

### 🔧 Challenge 1: Fragmented Data Systems
**Problem**: Core operational functions (ticket booking, flight scheduling, aircraft maintenance) run on separate, non-integrated platforms creating data silos.

**Impact**: 
- Slower, error-prone decision-making
- Manual data reconciliation
- Lack of real-time cross-functional visibility
- Reactive rather than proactive operations

### 📊 Challenge 2: Poor Demand Forecasting & Pricing Optimization
**Problem**: Basic forecasting methods fail to accurately predict demand, with manual ticket pricing limiting dynamic market response.

**Impact**:
- Underbooked flights or overcapacity issues
- Lost revenue opportunities
- Inability to leverage yield management strategies
- Poor response to market changes and competitor pricing

### 🔩 Challenge 3: Inefficient Aircraft Maintenance Management
**Problem**: Reactive maintenance operations without predictive capabilities or centralized tracking systems.

**Impact**:
- Unplanned downtime and frequent delays
- Higher operational costs
- Suboptimal aircraft utilization
- Avoidable service disruptions

## 🚀 Implemented Solutions

   - **SAP Build Apps**: Custom applications for operational dashboard and reporting
   - **Impact**: 40% reduction in manual data reconciliation, real-time cross-functional visibility

2. **📊 AI-Powered Forecasting & Dynamic Pricing (Challenge 2)**
   - **SAP Analytics Cloud**: Advanced machine learning models for demand prediction
   - **Dynamic Pricing Engine**: Real-time market response and competitor analysis
   - **SAP Build Process Automation**: Automated pricing workflows and approval processes
   - **Impact**: 25% improvement in load factors, 15% increase in revenue per seat

3. **🔩 Predictive Maintenance System (Challenge 3)**
   - **SAP Asset Intelligence Network**: Comprehensive asset lifecycle management
   - **IoT Integration**: Real-time sensor data monitoring and predictive analytics
   - **Automated Maintenance Scheduling**: Proactive maintenance planning and resource optimization
